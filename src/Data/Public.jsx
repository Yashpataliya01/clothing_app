    title: "Behind the Color: The Science of Fabric Dyeing Explained",
    description: `1. Yarn Dyed Fabric
Definition: The yarn is dyed first, and then it‚Äôs woven into fabric.
Key Features:
‚Üí Color penetrates deep into the yarn
‚Üí Enables intricate checks, stripes, and patterns
‚Üí High colorfastness (resistance to fading)
‚Üí Often seen in shirts, suiting fabrics, and uniforms where pattern consistency is critical
Use Case:
Ideal for uniforms with patterns or when rich, even color is needed across both sides of the fabric.
üß∫ 2. Piece Dyed Fabric
Definition:
Fabric is woven first in greige (raw, uncolored form) and then dyed in solid colors.
Key Features:
‚Üí Faster & cheaper than yarn dyeing
‚Üí Mostly used for solid-colored fabrics
‚Üí Limited to single-color looks
‚Üí Slightly less colorfast than yarn dyeing
Use Case:
Common for plain scrub fabrics, trousers, blouses, or any mass production with minimal design.
üß™ 3. Vat Dyeing (also known as Reactive Dyeing in some cases)
Definition:
A dyeing process where fabrics are immersed in a vat of insoluble dyes, then chemically treated to fix the dye permanently.
Key Features:
‚Üí Excellent colorfastness (resistant to washing, sunlight, and chemicals)
‚Üí Often used for cellulose fibers (like cotton, rayon)
‚Üí Rich, deep colors that last
‚Üí Slightly more technical and expensive
Use Case:
Perfect for workwear, medical scrubs, uniforms that undergo frequent industrial washing or exposure to sunlight.`,
